Started toy programming trying to make a fake dumbed down Spectromancer, a turn based card game based in a fantasy world.
Currently I'm working with the original resources, but the final goal is to have a decent ai so we can have fun making our own cards,
and play with them.

#### Running
- copy original images folder into resources
- update the java library path in build.sbt to suit your system
- download then copy slick, oscar jars in lib folders
- sbt run

#### Todo
- Improve Bot
- Health bar
- Effect card focus
- Spell anims
